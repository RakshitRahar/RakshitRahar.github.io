        <p>
          I am a MERN stack developer skilled in building full-stack web
          applications using MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js. I
          develop responsive user interfaces, create RESTful APIs, handle
          database operations, and ensure smooth integration between frontend
          and backend. I focus on writing clean code, implementing secure
          authentication, and deploying scalable applications.

          <h2>Frontend Development</h2>
          <p>
            Frontend development refers to the practice of creating the visual
            and interactive aspects of a website or web application that users
            directly engage with. It involves the use of technologies like HTML,
            CSS, and JavaScript to build responsive, accessible, and
            user-friendly interfaces. Frontend developers focus on designing
            layouts, styling components, handling user interactions, and
            ensuring cross-browser compatibility. They often work closely with
            designers and backend developers to deliver seamless user
            experiences. Modern frontend development may also include frameworks
            such as React, Angular, or Vue.js, and tools like Webpack, Tailwind
            CSS, and RESTful APIs to enhance functionality and performance.
          </p>

          <h2>Backend Development</h2>
          <p>
            Backend development focuses on the server-side logic, database
            management, and application integration that power websites and
            applications behind the scenes. Backend developers build and
            maintain the core functionality, APIs, and services that handle data
            processing, authentication, and server-side operations. Common
            technologies include Node.js, Python, Java, PHP, and databases such
            as MySQL, MongoDB, or PostgreSQL. Backend development ensures that
            frontend interfaces can reliably interact with the system, perform
            business logic, and deliver dynamic content securely and
            efficiently.

          <h2>Mobile App Development</h2>
          <p>
            Mobile development involves designing and building applications
            specifically for mobile devices like smartphones and tablets. This
            includes development for platforms such as Android (using Kotlin or
            Java) and iOS (using Swift or Objective-C), or cross-platform
            frameworks like Flutter, React Native, or Xamarin. Mobile developers
            focus on creating intuitive user interfaces, optimizing performance
            for small screens and varying hardware, and integrating features
            like cameras, GPS, and push notifications. Effective mobile
            development ensures smooth functionality, responsive design, and a
            seamless user experience across devices.
